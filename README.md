# SmartZone .NET Samples

These samples are intended to demonstrate how the various functions of SmartZone .NET can be used to perform tasks. These samples are designed to be lightweight, concise, and show how SmartZone can be integrated into any application to perform these imaging tasks.

## How to Build these Samples

All samples can be built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or later. To build any individual sample, use Visual Studio to open the .sln file in the individual project directory. After opening the solution, select a Solution Configuration (Debug or Release) and a Solution Platform (x64 or x86). Last, build the complete solution with Build Solution located in the Build menu.

## How to Run these Samples

When the solution is built, it produces one or more console application executables in 'bin' subdirectories in the individual project directories. Run the sample application by double-clicking the application icon, or running it directly from Command Prompt (cmd.exe), PowerShell, or similar. Note that the working directory must be the same as the directory containing the sample executable in order to find the sample input image and the output directory. The input image(s) and output directory are specified relative to the location of the application in all of these samples.

## System Requirements

For a list of the system and development software necessary to build and run these samples, please refer to the [SmartZone .NET Online Documentation](https://help.accusoft.com/SmartZone/latest/dotnet/webframe.html#overview.html).

## __Improve character recognition with our powerful ICR and OCR SDK.__

SmartZone's advanced zonal character recognition technology allows you to capture typed (OCR) or handwritten (ICR) data from specified fields in a document image or support full page OCR in your application. Optimize recognition with data matching/lookup, regular expressions, and custom character sets, and set confidence values to control when operators should review results. Available for .NET, our full-featured trial includes samples for VB.NET and C# to help you get started.

## Accelerate Forms Data Capture

Automate your forms data capture process to extract information from document images more efficiently.

## Eliminate Manual Errors

Full page and zonal OCR/ICR reads and extracts document image text to bypass the errors associated with manual data entry.

## Customize Data Capture

Capture text from any area of a document by establishing zones with expected character sets and regular expressions.

## Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

Read and capture machine-printed text using a library of predefined character sets that includes uppercase/lowercase letters, digits, currency, and punctuation.

## Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR)

Identify handwritten characters to extract text to databases and other applications, or use in the next step of your workflow.

## Adjustable Confidence Values

Set confidence values for recognition results to determine when manual review is necessary. Confidence values can be returned for individual characters, lines, or complete results.

## Extensive OCR Language Support

Support for multiple Western and Eastern languages, including Central European, Cyrillic, Baltic, and Asian languages. [See all supported languages](https://help.accusoft.com/SmartZone/latest/dotnet/webframe.html#Accusoft.SmartZoneOCR.Net~Accusoft.SmartZoneOCRSdk.Language.html).

## Zonal Field Recognition

Focus recognition engine on predefined form field types (such as name, date, time, email, SSN, phone) to reduce processing speed and improve accuracy.

## Full Page Recognition

Capture typed or hand-printed text from full document pages to accelerate processing workflows.
